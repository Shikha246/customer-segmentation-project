# customer-segmentation-project

**Project Overview**:  
This project aims to perform customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior using clustering algorithms (KMeans, Agglomerative Clustering, and DBSCAN). After identifying clusters, I applied classification algorithms like Random Forest and XGBoost to predict customer clusters.

**Key Results**:  
- Achieved 97% accuracy in predicting customer clusters using XGBoost.
- Performed feature scaling, hyperparameter tuning, and visualized insights.


**Technologies Used**:  
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
  

**Project Files**:
- `customer_personality_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with all the code and analysis.
- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset used for this analysis.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project.
## Cluster Visualizations

Here are the clusters generated by KMeans:
